              Identifies a transit brand which is often synonymous with a transit agency. Note that in some cases, such as when a single agency operates multiple separate services, agencies and brands are distinct. This document uses the term "agency" in place of "brand". A dataset may contain data from multiple agencies. Required when the dataset contains data for multiple transit agencies.

          - name: stop_code
            description: >
              Short text or a number that identifies the location for riders. These codes are often used in phone-based transit information systems or printed on signage to make it easier for riders to get information for a particular location. The stop_code may be the same as stop_id if it is public facing. This field should be left empty for locations without a code presented to riders.
          - name: stop_name
            description: >
              Name of the location. The stop_name should match the agency's rider-facing name for the location as printed on a timetable, published online, or represented on signage. For translations into other languages, use translations.txt. When the location is a boarding area (location_type=4), the stop_name should contains the name of the boarding area as displayed by the agency. It could be just one letter (like on some European intercity railway stations), or text like "Wheelchair boarding area" (NYC's Subway) or "Head of short trains" (Paris' RER).

            description: >
              Location type. Valid options are:
              0 (or empty) - Stop (or Platform). A location where passengers board or disembark from a transit vehicle. Is called a platform when defined within a parent_station.
              1 - Station. A physical structure or area that contains one or more platform.
              2 - Entrance/Exit. A location where passengers can enter or exit a station from the street. If an entrance/exit belongs to multiple stations, it may be linked by pathways to both, but the data provider must pick one of them as parent.
              3 - Generic Node. A location within a station, not matching any other location_type, that may be used to link together pathways define in pathways.txt.
              4 - Boarding Area. A specific location on a platform, where passengers can board and/or alight vehicles.
          - name: parent_station
            description: >
              Defines hierarchy between the different locations defined in stops.txt. It contains the ID of the parent location, as followed:
              - Stop/platform (location_type=0): the parent_station field contains the ID of a station.
              - Station (location_type=1): this field must be empty.
              - Entrance/exit (location_type=2) or generic node (location_type=3): the parent_station field contains the ID of a station (location_type=1)
              - Boarding Area (location_type=4): the parent_station field contains ID of a platform.
          - name: wheelchair_boarding
            description: >
              Indicates whether wheelchair boardings are possible from the location. Valid options are:
              For parentless stops:
              0 or empty - No accessibility information for the stop.
              1 - Some vehicles at this stop can be boarded by a rider in a wheelchair.
              2 - Wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stop.
              For child stops:
              0 or empty - Stop will inherit its wheelchair_boarding behavior from the parent station, if specified in the parent.
              1 - There exists some accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop/platform.
              2 - There exists no accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop/platform.
              For station entrances/exits:
              0 or empty - Station entrance will inherit its wheelchair_boarding behavior from the parent station, if specified for the parent.
              1 - Station entrance is wheelchair accessible.
              2 - No accessible path from station entrance to stops/platforms.
          - name: stop_timezone
            description: Timezone of the location. If the location has a parent station, it inherits the parent station's timezone instead of applying its own. Stations and parentless stops with empty stop_timezone inherit the timezone specified by agency.agency_timezone. The times provided in stop_times.txt are in the timezone specified by agency.agency_timezone, not stop_timezone. This ensures that the time values in a trip always increase over the course of a trip, regardless of which timezones the trip crosses.
          - name: level_id
            description: Level of the location. The same level may be used by multiple unlinked stations.
          - name: platform_code
            description: Platform identifier for a platform stop (a stop belonging to a station). This should be just the platform identifier (eg. "G" or "3"). Words like "platform" or "track" (or the feed's language-specific equivalent) should not be included. This allows feed consumers to more easily internationalize and localize the platform identifier into other languages.
